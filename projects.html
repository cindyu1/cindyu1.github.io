<h1 class="center">MY PROJECTS</h1>

<p class="center">Here is a list of the projects I have worked on for the past few years.</p>

<h2 class="center boldedtext">Center for Creativity Connect</h2>
<p class="indented">Center for Creativity Connect is an application created for the nonprofit organization
  <a href=""> The Chuck Jones Center for Creativity (CJCC)</a>. This project was part of the class IN4MTX 191A and
  191B, a student-run and student-driven senior project class.
  The app is dedicated to connect CJCC's network of
  teaching artists with the ability to sign up for different art programs and volunteer work through their mobile device. The
  application would allow the teaching artists to sign up with an account and log in to the system to apply for
  available art programs if they have the necessary skills and level of expertise. Users can also receive notifications
  about their upcoming programs along with an option for the teachers to check in to a program once it starts.
</p>
<img class="center_img" src="creativity connect mockups.png" alt="CJCC app mockups">
<p class="indented"> I worked with a group of six people to create this app from October 2018 to March 2019.
  I participated in multiple meetings with our sponsor Craig Kausen, the current owner of CJCC,
  to elicit necessary requirements to create the app. I worked with another group member to ensure that all requirements were
  correct and clear. As a group, we then analyzed the requirements and narrowed down the features that
  were necessary for the Minimum Viable Product. I also worked with the group's lead designer on the application's overall
  design and functionalities. We used a bright blue color scheme because our sponsor is about creativity and fun, but also
  emphasized simple features that any teaching artist, regardless of age or technological knowledge, would be able to use easily.
</p>
<p class="indented"> Our group faced multiple challenges along the way including scope creep; we
  had to decline creating the organization's desktop administrative application as there would be less time to complete the
  mobile application. We also faced problems with designing the visual interface for the application, as there were differing opinions
  about whether we should focus on creativity or usability. In the end we decided to focus more on usability so users would be able to
  view pages easily. We overcame these hurdles throughout our 20 weeks of working together and successfully completed the app for CJCC.
</p>

<h2 class="center boldedtext">Gratitude Journal</h2>
<p class="indented">Gratitude Journal is an application created for the class IN4MTX 134, User Interaction Software.
  I worked in a group of six people to create an application dedicated to mental health patients with a focus on
  artificial intelligence capabilities. Gratitude Journal is a personal journal application where users can submit daily entries of
  things that they are grateful for. The AI program embedded in the app develops further as the user continues to input more data and
  will suggest articles for the user to read based on their replies and interests. The app promotes positivity and gratefulness towards
  multiple things in life such as family, friends, and small items that bring happiness. From the start, our main focus was not to create the app based on curing mental health, but instead
  to make it a resource for individuals who need it. Since therapy can be expensive, especially for busy
  college students, the app would be a more accessible and cheaper alternative that will be available through mobile devices.

<h2 class="center boldedtext">FromYouFlowers Redesign</h2>
<p class="indented">This was a project for the IN4MTX 132 class which
 involved redesigning an existing website with better and more useful features that would help the website out in its overall goals. For my group, we chose an online flower website called FromYouFlowers
 where customers could buy flower bouquets online; we chose this site because we determined that the layout of the website was very messy and cluttered with its navigation and organizational structure.
 The report includes the redesigns that we have proposed for the website to make it more user friendly and personalized for customers who wanted an easier way to find the flowers that they would want to buy the most.
 We kept in mind the customers of FromYouFlowers as well as fellow competitors to create the best overall experience that would benefit both the company and their audience.

 <h2 class="center boldedtext"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17wmZFnuGkT3f690sSGjf6sD5RdSSp_ssfRmRzOfTYEI/edit?usp=sharing">Interactive Dollhouse</a></h2>
 <p class="indented">This was the final IN4MTX 121 design studio, involving designing an app where kids could buy a game for an interactive dollhouse.
 Our final product included having multiplayer functionalities and abilities to customize both their character and their dollhouse.
 Kids could also buy actual dollhouses and dolls to input codes that would give them extra, limited content connected to their physical toys.</p>

<h2 class="center boldedtext">Cosmic Eggstravaganza</h2>
<p class="center"><a href="https://oof-cosmic-eggstravaganza.weebly.com/">Website</a></p>
<p class="center">Design Document</p>
<p class="indented">This was a project for IN4MTX 125 / CS 113, a game development class.
  My group of five people created a pet simulation game that takes place in space.
  Players are stuck on an asteroid in space and are unable to get back home to their home planet without a spaceship. The main gameplay
  consists of the players raising unique pets and monsters on their farm by clicking and dragging them to various areas to raise their stats.
  Once players feel like their pets are strong and mature enough, they can then sell the pets to gain more money.
  The ultimate goal is to raise enough money to buy a new spaceship and go home.
</p>
<p>My main role in this project was lead artist. I created the art for everything in the game, which included the pets,
  background, and assets for the user interface. All of the art was sketched out on paper first before doing lineart and coloring
  through Adobe Photoshop. The game itself was created by our three programmers using Unity, and the sound assets were found on the Unity
  store.
